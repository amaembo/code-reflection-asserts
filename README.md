This is an experimental assertions library based on [Project Babylon](https://openjdk.org/projects/babylon/).
The idea is to show a comprehensive message with intermediate subexpression results, using code reflection.

For example, you may want to write the following test:

```java
List<Integer> big = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4);
List<Integer> small = List.of(2, 5);
RefAsserts.assertTrue(() -> big.containsAll(small));
```

The resulting failure message will be the following:

```
java.lang.AssertionError: failed
big -> [1, 2, 3, 4]
small -> [2, 5]
big.containsAll(small) -> false
```

So you can easily see the result of sub-expression computation.

Build
===

To build the project, you need to build the custom JDK from Babylon [Git repository](https://github.com/openjdk/babylon) (use code-reflection branch).
Alternatively, you can use ready [binary builds](https://builds.shipilev.net/openjdk-jdk-babylon-code-reflection/) provided by incredible Mr. Shipil—ëv.

After that, you can build and test like a normal Maven project.

Note that given the experimental nature of Babylon project, incompatible changes could be introduced in Babylon, 
which may prevent this project from building. No guarantees about compatibility.
